# Local-News-App

A web app that populates google maps with local news stories.

It was built while progressing through Harvard's online course CS50 It was built using the LAMP stack.

The majority of the code and features I contributed to this project can be seen in the following files:

search.php <br />
script.js <br />
index.html <br />
import.php <br />

The rest of the code was provided by the CS50 curriculum
